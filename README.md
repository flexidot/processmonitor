* What does it do?

Simple tool for process monitoring and alerting.

If a process that is monitored is not running, restart it, and alert someone via SMTP (sendgrid)
If a process is using too much memory, restart it, and alert someone
Create a time series of all processes, or selected processes

* Mail Integration
Right now only supports sendgrid, though no reason why any other SMTP can't be easily supported
